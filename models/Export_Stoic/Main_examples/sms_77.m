function [st si]=sms_77

%% Returns a matrix "st" representing the set of equalities that define
%% a 7x7 semi-magic square, i.e. constant row and column sums.
%% Also returns, "si" a vector of ones (nonnegativity for all variables).
%%
%% This is a test case for joint generation of a hypergraph & its dual.
